    Work in progress implementation of GSTs in Isabelle

    We begin to formalise 'Generalised Set Theory' in Isabelle/HOL,
    by first providing a definition of Generalised Zermelo-Fraenkel as a locale.
    GZF is an abstract specification of set theory, which must hold in any domain type.
    
    The GZF locale specifies assumptions for constants, and definitions and theorems
    which depend on them.
